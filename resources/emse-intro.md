## Lecture Topics
- History of empirical software engineering
- Overview of methods, topics
- Philosophy of Science
- Design Science

## Lecture Objectives
- Learn about different types of knowledge gleaned from empirical software engineering
- Understand the role of empirical software engineering in industry and academia (and the gap between the two)
- Understand why human and social aspects matter
- Explore different research paradigms and identify your philosophical stance
- Be able to think more critically about research findings and results
