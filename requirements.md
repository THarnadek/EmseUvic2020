# Requirements

**Prerequisites:**

- Reserved for students in the BSENG program or Computer Science students with Software Systems option, or graduate students with previous software engineering education or experience
- SENG 275 and one of SENG 350/360/371 for undergraduates (equivalent for graduate students)
- Minimum 4th year standing

**General Requirements:**

- This is a senior seminar style class assuming a professional approach to the course in terms of attendance and participation in the class and course
- Attendance in all class meetings (lectures, project #1 alignment session, and workshops) during the scheduled timeslot is **mandatory**. If you have to miss a class, please let the instructor know ahead of time.  Some classes may start or end early depending on the nature of the topic covered and available materials to be viewed offline.  Details will be posted on Slack in advance of the lecture (you should assume the lecture will consume the entire scheduled class time unless you hear otherwise).
- Readings/videos/podcasts will be assigned weekly and should be read/viewed/listened to in **advance** of the lectures and workshops.
- Blogposts must be finalized and submitted by 6pm on their due dates.
- There are no extensions for project deliverables. Watch below for information on how to submit the project deliverables.
- See the [course outlines](https://heat.csc.uvic.ca/coview/course/2020091/CSC578A) for other expectations, course policies, and official grade breakdown.
- Monitor messages on Slack for any changes in course delivery methods, tools used, project requirements and due dates.

**Course participation:**

There will be ample group activities throughout the term and opportunities to contribute to the course material and class discussions. 

**Blogposts:**

For each of our workshops, you will need to write a short blogpost of 3-4 paragraphs based on your reflections of the assigned materials for that workshop. 
Note, this post should not be a summary but should demonstrate you've read these materials, and that you have considered how to relate these materials to the earlir materials assigned for reading/watching/listening earlier in the term. 

In addition, each blogpost should list 1 question per assigned material/guest. 

The blogposts are due the day before the workshop by 5pm. 
You may however update them with additional thoughts and reflections during the workshop and submit it by the following Monday at 5pm.


**Project #1:**

This "literature review" project will have a main individual component worth 80% of the project #1 grade (with interim milestones), and a collaborative alignment step completed during class time on Nov 6th (the alignment part is worth 20% of your project #1 grade). 
Meeting the milestones is important so that we can give you feedback along the way if we notice some misunderstanding about the project requirements. 

This isn't a traditional review of the papers that authors would receive for their papers submitted to a conference, and the goal of the project is not to decide should they be published or not, but rather our goal is (as a class) is to determine what kinds of knowledge are captured in these papers in terms of
- descriptive or prescriptive knowledge), 
- which research methods they use (in terms of the research method categorization we discussed), which topics they address (using those by Swebok and in the Lenberg paper we will discuss in class) and 

You will each be assigned papers from the [ICSE 2020 technical track](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2020/icse-2020-papers?track=ICSE%20Technical%20Papers#event-overview). Your task is to read each of these, and answer a set of questions for each of the papers. 
Graduate students will be assigned 11 papers; undergraduate students will be assigned 7 papers. 

Each paper will have two "reviewers".  In the second phase, your task with be to "align" your answers with the other reviewer.
To submit your answers, please use this form: https://www.surveymonkey.ca/r/emseuvic for each of your assigned papers. 
Make sure you fill out the form for the correct paper (select the paper carefully in the survey pulldown box). 

Later we will use a giant google spreadsheet to carry out our alignment activity! 


#### Project #1 Milestones:

| Date | Graduate Students | Undergraduate Students| 
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Oct 14, 5pm | 3 papers | 2 papers |
| Oct 21, 5pm | 3 papers | 2 papers |
| Oct 28, 5pm | 3 papers | 2 papers |
| Nov 3, 5pm | 2 papers | 1 paper |
| Nov 6, due by 5pm | Prepare for/do alignment | Prepare for/do alignment |





**Project #2:** 

This project will be to replicate or redesign an empirical study (of your choice) in software engineering. 
The project will be ideally completed in teams, but students can complete it alone if they wish. 
Each student/team member is required to do the following:

1. Follow any updates on this site and meet all of the established interim milestones.
2. Attend all the lectures during the semester, as these will prepare you to succeed in this project.
3. Together with your team mates, choose a topic for your project (details to follow).
4. Contribute equitably throughout the term to the team project in terms of research, video and paper writing.
5. Grade will be determined on a combination of the following:
    - 30% of your grade for this project component will be given for presentation in class (prepared video)
    - 70% of your grade will be based on the final report and meeting milestones throughout the term
    - Several milestones will be established for early versions of the report and project ideas.
    - Extra points may be given for: challenging projects, original ideas, collaboration with external organizations.
    
#### Project #2 Miletones:

| Date | Milestone | % of Project Grade |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- | 
| Nov 16, 5pm | Project proposal | 10% | 
| Nov 30, 5pm | Interim report | 20% | 
| Dec 4, 9am | Video presentation | 20% | 
| Dec 11, 5pm | Final report | 50% \
