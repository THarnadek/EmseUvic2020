# Requirements

**Prerequisites:**

- Reserved for students in the BSENG program or Computer Science students with Software Systems option, or graduate students with previous software engineering education or experience
- SENG 275 and one of SENG 350/360/371 for undergraduates (equivalent for graduate students)
- Minimum 4th year standing

**General Requirements:**

- This is a senior seminar style class assuming a professional approach to the course in terms of attendance and participation in the class and course
- Attendance in all class meetings (lectures, project #1 alignment session, and workshops) during the scheduled timeslot is **mandatory**. If you have to miss a class, please let the instructor know ahead of time.  Some classes may start or end early depending on the nature of the topic covered and available materials to be viewed offline.  Details will be posted on Slack in advance of the lecture (you should assume the lecture will consume the entire scheduled class time unless you hear otherwise).
- Readings/videos/podcasts will be assigned weekly and should be read/viewed/listened to in **advance** of the lectures and workshops.
- Blogposts must be finalized and submitted by 6pm on their due dates.
- There are no extensions for project deliverables. See below for information on how to submit the project deliverables.
- See the [course outlines](https://heat.csc.uvic.ca/coview/course/2020091/CSC578A) for other expectations, course policies, and official grade breakdown.
- Monitor messages on Slack for any changes in course delivery methods, tools used, project requirements and due dates.

## Course participation:

There will be ample group activities throughout the term and opportunities to contribute to the course material and class discussions. 

## Blogposts:

For each of our workshops, you will write a short blogpost of approx. 3-4 paragraphs based on your reflections of the assigned materials (readings/videos/podcasts) for that workshop. 
Note, this post should not be merely a summary of the readings but your personal reflection of how these relate to your own experience and knowledge,  and the content discussed earlier in the course.  Your post should make it clear though that you've read and thought about these materials in preparation for the workshop. 

In addition, each blogpost should list at most one clearly stated question per assigned material/guest. 

The blogposts are due by 6pm the day before each workshop (Thursday).
You may update your posts with additional thoughts and reflections during the workshop (e.g., how your question was answered explicitly or indirectly). 
Please make any changes by the following Monday at 5pm and make sure we can easily identify the changed content.


## Project #1:

For this project we will conduct a review of papers published at the flagship conference in software engineering in 2020.

This isn't a traditional review of the papers that authors would receive for their papers when submitted to a conference, 
but rather our goal is (as a class) to determine answers to the following questions about these papers:
- who are the **beneficiaries** of the reported research (see the WWH framework); 
- what kinds of **knowledge** are captured in these papers in terms of descriptive or prescriptive knowledge (see our reading on Design Science); 
- which empirical **research methods** (if any) are used in the papers and how do the methods used meet the quality criteria of **generalizability, control, precision and realism** (see readings by McGrath and the WWH framework) 
- which **software engineering topics** do these papers cover (according to the topics specified by Swebok and used in the Lenberg systematic mapping paper we discussed); 
- for the empirical papers, how do the authors convince the readers that their research and findings are **novel, rigorous, and relevant** to others (see Design science paper); 
- what is your personal opinion of the **importance** of this research (using similar criteria suggested by this David Lo paper). 

You will each be assigned a set of papers from the [ICSE 2020 technical track](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2020/icse-2020-papers?track=ICSE%20Technical%20Papers#event-overview). Your task is to read and think critically about each of these papers, and answer the above set of questions for each of them (there are also some bonus questions!). 
Graduate students will be assigned 11 papers; undergraduate students will be assigned 7 papers. 
Note that several of the questions ask you to elaborate on your decisions for type of paper etc, for many of these you can copy/paste quotes directly from the papers you are reading.
To submit your individual answers for each paper, please use this form: https://www.surveymonkey.ca/r/emseuvic for each of your assigned papers. 
Make sure you fill out the form for the correct paper (select the paper carefully in the survey pulldown box). 
Meeting the milestones (you will review some papers each week) is important so that we can give you feedback along the way if we notice some misunderstanding about the project requirements. 

Each paper will have two "reviewers".  In the second phase, your task with be to "align" your answers with the other reviewer.
This may not always be easy, so make sure you have a solid justification for your choices to some of the questions.
For this phase, we will use a giant google spreadsheet to record our alignment activity (when you disagree with the other reviewer, you will need to say why you disagree) and we will finally visualize the results as a class! 


#### Project #1 Milestones and Grading

| Date | Graduate Students | Undergraduate Students| 
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Oct 14, 5pm | 3 papers | 2 papers |
| Oct 21, 5pm | 3 papers | 2 papers |
| Oct 28, 5pm | 3 papers | 2 papers |
| Nov 3, 5pm | 2 papers | 1 paper |
| Nov 6, due by 5pm | Prepare for/do alignment | Prepare for/do alignment |

The individual work of this assignment is worth 80% of the project #1 grade (interim milestones must be followed). 
The collaborative alignment phase completed during class time on Nov 6th is worth 20% of your project #1 grade.  You should prepare before class for this alignment activity.


## Project #2: 

For this project, you will conduct a replication of an existing study published in a software engineering research venue, or you may wish to design a novel study. 
The project should ideally be completed in teams of 3-4 students, but students can complete it alone or in pairs if they wish.

If your project will involve a study with the direct participation of human subjects (e.g., lab experiment, observations, focus group, interviews, surveys), you will need to submit a brief application for ethics approval.  We will post details on this process here shortly. 

For some ideas of projects you can replicate that are based on data traces only, you may get some ideas from this book: http://www.knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/ (see also  
https://github.com/Derek-Jones/ESEUR-book).

#### Project proposal

Format:  PDF document, submitted via Connex. 1-2 pages.

This should describe the study you wish to replicate or new study you wish to design with the following information:
- Team members (if any)
- Motivation
- Research goal or question
- Research Strategies
- Potential Limitations
- Expected Results 
- Core References

#### Project interim reports 

Format: PDF document, submitted via Connex. This will be in the 3-4 page range using the ACM format described here: https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template

The interim project report should be a stand-alone document describing your progress so far on the project. Consider it as an early (but incomplete) preliminary version of your final report (see below). It should include early versions of most sections of the anticipated final report. 

### Project video
- Approx. 5 min video describing your project (motivation, methods, what you learned, what's next).  You may wish to host this on YouTube (or Vimeo) and submit the link via Connex. 

#### Project final report

Format: PDF document, submitted via Connex. This will be in the 8-12 page range (not including appendices). Use the format described at this page: https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template

The following shows a typical outline, but your project may require a different outline.  Check with the course staff if you are unsure!
- Introduction
   - Motivation for this research, to whom is it relevant and why
- Related work (this may come later in your paper!)
   - Brief literature review on this topic
- Research questions and methodology
- Results or Findings
- Discussion
- Limitations
- Conclusion/Future work
- References
- Appendix A: describe and provide links to any supplementary materials or replication package.
- Appendix B: if this was does as a team, please include a description of how the team members contributed to the project.

#### Project #2 Advice
Each student/team member is required to do the following:

1. Follow any updates on this site and meet all of the established interim milestones.
2. Attend all the lectures during the semester, as these will prepare you to succeed in this project.
3. Together with your team mates (if any), choose a topic for your project (details to follow).
4. Contribute equitably throughout the term to the team project in terms of research, video and paper writing.
5. Grade will be determined on a combination of the following:
    - 20% of your grade for this project component will be given for presentation in class (prepared video)
    - 80% of your grade will be based on the final report and meeting milestones throughout the term
    - Extra points may be given for: challenging projects, original ideas, collaboration with external organizations.
