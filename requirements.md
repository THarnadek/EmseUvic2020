5. Grade will be determined on a combination of the following:
    - 30% of your grade for this project component will be given for presentation in class (prepared video)
    - 70% of your grade will be based on the final report and meeting milestones throughout the term
    - Several milestones will be established for early versions of the report and project ideas.
    - Extra points may be given for: challenging projects, original ideas, collaboration with external organizations.
