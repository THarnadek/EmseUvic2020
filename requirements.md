# Requirements

**Prerequisites:**

- Reserved for students in the BSENG program or Computer Science students with Software Systems option, or graduate students with previous software engineering education or experience
- SENG 275 and one of SENG 350/360/371 for undergraduates (equivalent for graduate students)
- Minimum 4th year standing

**General Requirements:**

- This is a senior seminar style class assuming a professional approach to the course in terms of attendance and participation in the class and course
- Attendance in all class meetings (lectures, project #1 alignment session, and workshops) during the scheduled timeslot is **mandatory**. If you have to miss a class, please let the instructor know ahead of time.  Some classes may start or end early depending on the nature of the topic covered and available materials to be viewed offline.  Details will be posted on Slack in advance of the lecture (you should assume the lecture will consume the entire scheduled class time unless you hear otherwise).
- Readings/videos/podcasts will be assigned weekly and should be read/viewed/listened to in **advance** of the lectures and workshops.
- Blogposts must be finalized and submitted by 6pm on their due dates.
- There are no extensions for project deliverables. Watch below for information on how to submit the project deliverables.
- See the [course outlines](https://heat.csc.uvic.ca/coview/course/2020091/CSC578A) for other expectations, course policies, and official grade breakdown.
- Monitor messages on Slack for any changes in course delivery methods, tools used, project requirements and due dates.

## Course participation:

There will be ample group activities throughout the term and opportunities to contribute to the course material and class discussions. 

## Blogposts:

For each of our workshops, you will write a short blogpost of approx. 3-4 paragraphs based on your reflections of the assigned materials (readings/videos/podcasts) for that workshop. 
Note, this post should not be merely a summary of the readings but your personal reflection of how these relate to your own experience and knowledge,  and the content discussed earlier in the course.  Your post should make it clear though that you've read and thought about these materials in preparation for the workshop. 

In addition, each blogpost should list at most one clearly stated question per assigned material/guest. 

The blogposts are due the day before (Thursday) each workshop by 5pm. 
You may update your posts with additional thoughts and reflections during the workshop (e.g., how your question was answered explicitly or indirectly). 
Please make any changes by the following Monday at 5pm and make sure it is clear what you added that is new.


## Project #1:

This project is a "class" project that will conduct a review of papers published at the flagship conference in software engineering in 2020.

This isn't a traditional review of the papers that authors would receive for their papers when submitted to a conference, 
but rather our goal is (as a class) to determine answers to the following questions about these papers:
- who are the **beneficiaries** of the reported research (see the WWH framework); 
- what kinds of **knowledge** are captured in these papers in terms of descriptive or prescriptive knowledge (see our reading on Design Science); 
- which empirical **research methods** (if any) are used in the papers and how do the methods used meet the quality criteria of **generalizability, control, precision and realism** (see readings by McGrath and the WWH framework) 
- which **software engineering topics** do these papers cover (according to the topics specified by Swebok and used in the Lenberg paper systematic mapping paper); 
- for the empirical papers, how do the authors convince the readers that their research and findings are **novel, rigorous, and relevant** to others (see Design science paper); 
- what is your personal opinion of the **importance** of this research (using similar criteria suggested by the David Lo paper). 

You will each be assigned a set of papers from the [ICSE 2020 technical track](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2020/icse-2020-papers?track=ICSE%20Technical%20Papers#event-overview). Your task is to read each of these papers, and answer the above set of questions for each of them. 
Graduate students will be assigned 11 papers; undergraduate students will be assigned 7 papers. 

Each paper will have two "reviewers".  In the second phase, your task with be to "align" your answers with the other reviewer.
To submit your answers for each paper, please use this form: https://www.surveymonkey.ca/r/emseuvic for each of your assigned papers. 
Make sure you fill out the form for the correct paper (select the paper carefully in the survey pulldown box). 

Later we will use a giant google spreadsheet to carry out our alignment activity and we will visualize the results! 


#### Project #1 Milestones and Grading

| Date | Graduate Students | Undergraduate Students| 
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Oct 14, 5pm | 3 papers | 2 papers |
| Oct 21, 5pm | 3 papers | 2 papers |
| Oct 28, 5pm | 3 papers | 2 papers |
| Nov 3, 5pm | 2 papers | 1 paper |
| Nov 6, due by 5pm | Prepare for/do alignment | Prepare for/do alignment |

The individual work of this assignment is worth 80% of the project #1 grade (assuming the interim milestones were followed), 
and a collaborative alignment step completed during class time on Nov 6th (the alignment part is worth 20% of your project #1 grade). 
Meeting the milestones is important so that we can give you feedback along the way if we notice some misunderstanding about the project requirements. 


## Project #2: 

This project will be to replicate or redesign an empirical study (of your choice) in software engineering. 
The project will be ideally completed in teams, but students can complete it alone if they wish. 
Each student/team member is required to do the following:

1. Follow any updates on this site and meet all of the established interim milestones.
2. Attend all the lectures during the semester, as these will prepare you to succeed in this project.
3. Together with your team mates, choose a topic for your project (details to follow).
4. Contribute equitably throughout the term to the team project in terms of research, video and paper writing.
5. Grade will be determined on a combination of the following:
    - 30% of your grade for this project component will be given for presentation in class (prepared video)
    - 70% of your grade will be based on the final report and meeting milestones throughout the term
    - Several milestones will be established for early versions of the report and project ideas.
    - Extra points may be given for: challenging projects, original ideas, collaboration with external organizations.
